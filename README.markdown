AgnesBot is a pluggable and modular IRC bot written in C# using .NET 4.0, Castle and RavenDB.

A couple of modules are provided out of the box:

 - Comment Module
 - TinyUrl Module
 - Url Aggregator Module

RavenDB is used as a data store which any developed modules will be able to use. 

Future plans are to add modules for Teamcity/CC.NET.
